# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System 🤖

Welcome to the **Movie Recommendation System**! 🚀 This project allows you to find similar movies based on a movie you enter. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms, it analyzes movie genres, keywords, and cast to recommend the most similar films. It's like having your own movie assistant! 🎥🍿

## 🛠️ **Technologies Used**:
- **Python** 🐍: The brain of the entire process.
- **Pandas** 📊: For handling and processing large amounts of data.
- **Numpy** 🔢: For mathematical operations and efficient array manipulation.
- **Scikit-learn** 🤖: For applying **Cosine Similarity** and other machine learning techniques.
- **SQLite** 💾: For storing and querying the movie database.
- **Matplotlib** 📈 and **Seaborn** 🌈: For creating visualizations and interactive charts.

## 🚀 **Features**:
- **Movie Data Import** 🎬: Loads movie information from CSV files containing movie details, credits, and additional metadata.
- **Data Preprocessing** 🔄: Cleans and processes data by removing unnecessary spaces, handling missing values, and converting lists into strings for analysis.
- **Cosine Similarity** 🧠: Uses **cosine similarity** on movie tags (genres, keywords, cast, etc.) to find the most similar movies to the one entered by the user.
- **Movie Recommendations** 📽️: Enter a movie title and get a list of the most similar movies based on the content of its tags.

## 🔧 **Example**:
### Input: 
Enter a movie title: The Hunger Games
### Output:
Recommendations for movies similar to 'The Hunger Games':

- The Hunger Games: Catching Fire (Similarity: 0.37) 🔥
- The Hunger Games (Similarity: 0.36) 🏹
- The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 (Similarity: 0.31) 💥
- Journey 2: The Mysterious Island (Similarity: 0.20) 🏝️
- Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome (Similarity: 0.19) 🚗💨

## 🧑‍💻 **Data Sources**:
The dataset used in this project comes from **TMDb (The Movie Database)**, a movie database containing information on over 5,000 movies, their cast, directors, genres, keywords, and much more. 🎞️
